# Contributing to Monekin

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Monekin. It's people like you that make this application such a great tool.

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved. If you are a developer and you want to get your hands dirty right now, go directly to our [code contributions guide](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/blob/main/docs/CODE_CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Reporting issues and requesting features

Have you encountered a bug or thought of a way to improve Monekin? If so, we will be very grateful to hear from you to solve it as soon as possible. Both bugs and feature ideas can be submitted through GitHub Issues, but we ask you to follow a few guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration:

### Before Submitting

1. **Search First**: Check the [open issues](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions) to see if the bug or feature idea has already been reported.

   - If you find an existing issue or discussion, upvote it by adding a 👍 reaction to the top post. This helps us prioritize items with the most community interest.
   - You can also subscribe to the issue or discussion to stay updated on any progress.

2. **Comment Responsibly**: If you have additional relevant details or context, feel free to leave a comment. However, avoid adding comments like "+1" or "I have this issue too", use reactions instead to express your support and **keep the discussion clean**.

We prioritize issues and feature requests based on community interest and relevance to the app’s goals. Items with more reactions, thoughtful comments, and active engagement will be considered first, so make sure to show your support for ideas you find important!

### Submitting the issue / feature request

If your bug or feature idea hasn’t been reported yet:

1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues) and click the green button at the top-right of the page.
2. Select the appropriate template (e.g., bug report or feature request).
3. Provide as much detail as possible

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your feature idea isn’t fully developed or lacks clear requirements, [post your idea/request in the Monekin Forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions/new?category=ideas-new-features). The mantainers and the community of Monekin will help you giving shape to your idea. Once it gains clarity and support, it can be formalized into an issue to be developed.

## Use the forum

The [Monekin Forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions) is where the community comes together to share ideas, ask questions, and collaborate. If you have a question or need help, the Q&A section is the place to start. You can also use the forum to showcase how you’re using Monekin in your projects, share tips, or discuss new feature ideas in a more informal way. Whether you’re looking for support or want to engage with others, the forum is a great way to connect and contribute to the Monekin community.
